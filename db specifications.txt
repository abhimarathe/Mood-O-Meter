I used MongoDB as the back-end system for handling crash reports and incoming POST messages from the Android devices.

The main reason for using MongoDB was that of flexibility, which unstructured data provides. Documents (JSON) can directly be pushed into the database without having to undergo tedious parsing.

MongoDB interfaces seamlessly with Python via the PyMongo driver. You may find more details over here -> https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/

The database layout can be visualized in the following way:

db
  |- flask
      |- sentiments       //this collection stores all the incoming POST messages from Android.
          stores document in the form of {base64string, emotion, smiling_probability}
      |- crash_reports    //this collection stores error log dumps as-is.
          to see the structure of the json dump, please refer to this GitHub gist -> https://gist.github.com/KevinGaudin/5557961
